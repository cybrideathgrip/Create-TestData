# Create-TestData
short script to create a csv of test data for a test database

I was not about to "think up" random, names, ID numbers, and expiration dates 30 times for some sample data.
So I decided to spend way more time writing a script this 1 time for this 1 purpose.

The only fun part here was learning the Random number functions.   
Everything else came from a file.  
Formatting dates was fun.  

I should've written this in python to better learn that syntax. Could still transcribe.
